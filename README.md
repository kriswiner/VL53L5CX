# VL53L5CX

Some examples for the ST's VL53L5CX 8 x 8 pixel ranging camera using Simon Levy's Arduino [library](https://github.com/simondlevy/VL53L5) and Seth Bonn's multi-byte I2C read and write formulations. Example 2 shows how to use the interrupt for data ready as well as allowing some basic parameters to be set like data rate and pixel array, etc.
