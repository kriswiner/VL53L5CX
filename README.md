# VL53L5CX

Some examples for the ST's VL53L5CX 8 x 8 pixel ranging camera using Simon Levy's Arduino [library](https://github.com/simondlevy/VL53L5) and Seth Bonn's multi-byte I2C read and write functions. 

Example 2 shows how to use the interrupt for data ready as well as allowing some basic parameters to be set like data rate and pixel array size, etc.

I am using this [VL53L5CX](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/vl53l5cx-ranging-camera/) breakout board with the [Ladybug](https://www.tindie.com/products/tleracorp/ladybug-stm32l432-development-board/) STM32L432 development board.
